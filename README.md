# 🐍 Python Game using Python (Snake game)

A classic Snake game built using **Python** and the **turtle** graphics library! This project is a simple and fun implementation of the popular arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or itself.

<br>

## 🐢 Built With

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) — standard Python graphics library used for drawing and animation.

<br>

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to control the direction of the snake.
- Eat the food to grow longer.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or your own tail — that ends the game!

<br>

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system (no extra libraries required — `turtle` comes with Python).
